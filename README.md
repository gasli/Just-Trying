# Just-Trying

Student Automation System which is basic program with python. There are lots of bugs and deficiencies in this project like;

- not used try catch, must be add try-catch operations and some conditions especially be clear for inputs testing parts
- can be add json or database for storing informations, even must be store hashes+salt passwords and username for security case
- can be add some useful functions 


Open for developing or purpose of giving an idea for beginner
